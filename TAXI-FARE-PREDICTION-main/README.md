# TAXI-FARE-PREDICTION
In the last few years, the number of for hire-vechiles operating in NY has grown from 63,000 to more than 1,00,000. however, while the number of trips in app based vechiles has increased from 6 million to
17 million a year, taxis trips have fallen from 11 million to 8.5 million.Hence, the NY yellow cab organisation decided to become more data centric.Then we have apps like Uber,Olaetc.

Problem Statement
given pickup and drop off locations, the pickup timestamp, and the passanger count, the objective is to predict the fare.

In this i have used grading boosting regressor to  find the prediction of taxi fares. it is a complex data which involves a lot of preprocessing and feature engineering steps to develope the model
