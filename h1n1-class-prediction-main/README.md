# h1n1-class-prediction
This code represents a machine learning model for predicting H1N1 vaccine adoption based on a range of demographic and behavioral features. The model is written in Python, using various packages such as NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy, and has several execution controls to allow for flexibility in running specific processes.

Here is a brief overview of the model's components:

The model can perform either classification or regression, as determined by the 'classification' variable.
Data can be read in from a CSV file, with the location of the file specified by the 'filepath' variable.
Primary data analysis can be performed by setting the 'primary_analysis' variable to 1. This includes analyzing features, identifying unwanted ones, converting datatypes, and determining missing values.
Visual analysis can be performed by setting the 'visual_analysis' variable to 1.
Feature engineering is optional and subject to the user's discretion. It can be enabled by setting the 'feature_engineering' variable to 1.
Missing value analysis and treatment can be performed by setting 'analyze_missing_values' and 'treat_missing_values' to 1, respectively.
Variables can be defined by setting the 'define_variables' variable to 1.
Statistics analysis can be performed by setting 'analyze_stats' to 1. This includes feature selection, removing correlated features, and Gaussian/polynomial transformations.
Lastly, the model allows for comparing two sets of results with the 'compare' variable, and cross-validation and grid search can be performed with 'cross_validate' and 'grid_search', respectively.
Note that some variables are set to 1 only for development purposes, such as 'primary_analysis' and 'analyze_stats'. The code can be customized for specific use cases, depending on the nature of the data and the desired output.
